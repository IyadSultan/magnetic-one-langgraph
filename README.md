# MagneticOne Multi-Agent System - Open-Source Exploration

Welcome to the open-source exploration of Microsoftâ€™s MagneticOne multi-agent system! This repository provides a summarized workflow, a visual diagram, and an initial implementation in LangGraph. We encourage the community to contribute, test, and enhance this adaptation from Autogen to LangGraph.

---


## Overview

The MagneticOne multi-agent system, developed by Microsoft, is designed to enable efficient, multi-agent coordination and decision-making. This repository aims to:
1. Explain the workflow of MagneticOne in a concise format.
2. Provide a simple diagram to visualize the core process.
3. Present a first draft implementation of the workflow using LangGraph.

This project serves as a foundation for adapting Microsoft's work with Autogen to a LangGraph-based system.

## Background

The MagneticOne system is a **generalist multi-agent system** developed to solve complex, multi-step tasks through effective agent collaboration. For a deeper understanding of the original MagneticOne project, refer to the following resources provided by Microsoft:

- **Blog Post**: [Magnetic One: A Generalist Multi-Agent System for Solving Complex Tasks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/magentic-one-a-generalist-multi-agent-system-for-solving-complex-tasks/)
- **Research Paper**: [Magnetic One - Microsoft Research Paper (PDF)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2024/11/Magentic-One.pdf)
- **Official GitHub Repository**: [Autogen MagneticOne on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/python/packages/autogen-magentic-one)

These references provide insights into the original design, architecture, and goals of MagneticOne, laying the groundwork for this open-source adaptation.
